Revision history for Perl extension Business::Cart::Generic.

0.82  Thu Apr 21 10:45:00 2011
	- Implement online orders. This required many changes, including abandoning the countries/zones from
	  osCommerse, and using those from Locale::SubCountry instead (to implement the onChange logic for the
	  countries menu wiht less pain).
	- Change code, and docs, so storing data into order_items table does not perform calculations, e.g. tax.
	  Only perform calculations when reporting (outputting order items, totals).
	- Split place.orders.pl into import.products.pl and place.orders.pl.
	- Fix typo in dir name in $HOME/.perl/Business-Cart-Generic/ which used junk left over
	  of copy-and-paste from Benchmark-Featureset-LocaleCountry. This is a doc fix only, in
	  Business::Cart::Generic.
	- Stop dropping temp product_* tables in Loader.populate_tables(), since that was interferring
	  with the drop/create/populate/place.order cycle.
	- Rename order.index.page.tx to export.order.index.page.tx, and order.page.tx to export.order.page.tx,
	  to make room for online order templates.
	- Add country to data/order.items.csv and data/tax.rates.csv, and rearrange order of columns in those files.
	  This is to fix the problem where 2 zones in different countries have the same code, e.g. VIC.
	  Change Database::Loader to match.
	- Change auto-generated model in products table from (sprintf) SKU-%02i to SKU-%04i.
	- Remove product and model columns from data/order.items.csv. They're redundant in demo data.
	- Add online.order.page.(js,tx), for use by the Order tab. Add View::Order and Controller::Order to match.
	- After searching for order, fix calculation of total price and tax.

	- Add use strict/warnings to various modules.
	- Rename Change.ini to Changelog.ini.
	- Rename output of scripts/export.orders.as.html.pl from order.html to orders.html.
	- Clean up handing of HTML border option in templates.
	- Fix drop table code to not log drop of log table.
	- Remove redundant references to IO::Scalar.
	- Make Build.PL and Makefile.PL run scripts/copy.config.pl.
	- Expand docs to discuss config/.htbusiness.cart.generic.conf, and scripts/copy.config.pl.
	  This section was missing from the docs in V 0.80.
