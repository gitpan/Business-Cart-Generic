- Implement online orders. This required many changes, including abandoning the countries/zones from
osCommerse, and using those from Locale::SubCountry instead (to implement the onChange logic for the
countries menu wiht less pain).
- Change code, and docs, so storing data into order_items table does not perform calculations, e.g. tax.
Only perform calculations when reporting (outputting order items, totals).
- Split place.orders.pl into import.products.pl and place.orders.pl.
- Fix typo in dir name in $HOME/.perl/Business-Cart-Generic/ which used junk left over
of copy-and-paste from Benchmark-Featureset-LocaleCountry. This is a doc fix only, in
Business::Cart::Generic.
- Stop dropping temp product_* tables in Loader.populate_tables(), since that was interferring
with the drop/create/populate/place.order cycle.
- Rename order.index.page.tx to export.order.index.page.tx, and order.page.tx to export.order.page.tx,
to make room for online order templates.
- Add country to data/order.items.csv and data/tax.rates.csv, and rearrange order of columns in those files.
This is to fix the problem where 2 zones in different countries have the same code, e.g. VIC.
Change Database::Loader to match.
- Change auto-generated model in products table from (sprintf) SKU-%02i to SKU-%04i.
- Remove product and model columns from data/order.items.csv. They're redundant in demo data.
- Add online.order.page.(js,tx), for use by the Order tab. Add View::Order and Controller::Order to match.
- After searching for order, fix calculation of total price and tax.
